# Bank tech test

## Requirements

- Interact with the code via IRB (Don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
- Deposits, withdrawal.
- Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

## First rough design

Based on the requirements given in the [original Github repo] (/makersacademy/course/blob/master/individual_challenges/bank_tech_test.md) a rough design, to highlight my earliest thinking.

## First object design

A first sketch, to outline thoughts around objects (classes, methods, arguments)
